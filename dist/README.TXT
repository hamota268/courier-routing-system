# Courier-Routing-System

## By Youssef Mohamed @ computer science

# This project is a design and implementation for an application that optimizes courier routing using graph algorithms.

# In this project I created a good-looking GUI using Java forms to make it more user-friendly.

# The user just needs to enter some queries which are the distance, the number of cities, and the cities.

# I used two main Algorithms: Dijkstra, and the TSP algorithm.

# Hope this project benefits the community.

Notes:

* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first
JAR file is copied to the lib folder.
* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)
are not copied.
* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path element
specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on
the projects runtime path.
* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node
in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the
class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the
class name in the manifest Main-Class element.
