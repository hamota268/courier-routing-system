# Courier-Routing-System

## By Youssef Mohamed @ computer science 

# This project is a design and implementation for an application that optimizes courier routing using graph algorithms.

# In this project I created a good-looking GUI using Java forms to make it more user-friendly.

# The user just needs to enter some queries which are the distance, the number of cities, and the cities.

# I used two main Algorithms: Dijkstra, and the TSP algorithm.

# Hope this project benefits the community.
